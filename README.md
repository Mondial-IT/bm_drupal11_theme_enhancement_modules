## Drupal 11
Drupal 11 is the latest major release of the open-source content management framework widely used for enterprise websites, portals, and headless content APIs. It builds on the stability and modular design of Drupal 10 while modernizing its core to take advantage of the latest versions of PHP, Symfony, and Twig. The platform provides developers with flexible content modeling, multilingual capabilities, and a mature caching system that can scale efficiently for high-traffic environments. Its focus on API-first design makes it ideal for integration with decoupled frontends, mobile apps, and third-party services.

For DevOps professionals, Drupal 11 introduces improvements that simplify deployment and maintenance. The core system supports configuration management through YAML files, making environment synchronization easier in CI/CD pipelines. Composer-based dependency management is now the default, enabling more predictable builds and security patching. Combined with containerization tools like Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes, Drupal 11 can be deployed, scaled, and monitored as part of a modern cloud-native infrastructure.
